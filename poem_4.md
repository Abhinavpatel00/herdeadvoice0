# Shattered Yet Unbroken

## Abhinav Patel

The sorrow that doth plague her soul
A pain that none but she doth know
Her tears fall like summer rain
A silent plea for love in vain

What horrors must making everything endure
That she doth cry and wail so pure
A heart so burdened with such strife
That every night she takes her life

Her spirit was crushed, her body weak
No refuge left for her to seek
A victim of a cruel design
A prisoner of a world unkind

How the world hath failed this fair
Injustice doth her life ensnare
But yet she doth not yield to fate
For hope still lingers, though it's late

With every tear, she finds the strength
To carry on, despite the length
Of the path, she must tread alone
Her courage is like a diamond stone

And so she cries, with a heart so bold
For all the tales that go untold
For every soul that suffers so
For every heart that longs to know

May heaven's light guide her way
And bring her solace every day
For in her tears doth lie the power
To conquer all, in life's darkest hour
