# Her Trapped Soul

## Aditi Jogdand

She is frightened deep inside  
Sorrow and hopelessness beside  
Surrounded by unseen, threatening presence of them  
Which brutally grabs her soul in insecurity and blame  

Her smile faded away with her hopes, dreams for the future  
Now just depression, anxiety that's what she nurtures  
The curiosity she had as a child  
Is bothering massive cyclones which aren't mild
