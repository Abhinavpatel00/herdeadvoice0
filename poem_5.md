# Darkest Sunset

## Abhinav Patel

To whom have we blamed till long ?
But the real monster continued to kill innocent souls along,
Who is to blame in this darkening time,
When so many have been subjected to crime?
For whom are we turning a searching eye,
As innocent girls must suffer and cry?

Soft innocence used as a weapon of fate,
The faces of sweet lasses filled with hate.
What fearful power doth hold up their hand,
Deeming that these young victims must endure such pain?

The blackest hearts can weaponize fear;
Young girl's lives thrown in disarray and queer.
Our world's foundations swept out from beneath;
Young girls stand broken in stagnant tears beneath.

So now we must take up justice's call;
Our souls must show that villains won't win at all!
Know this the fight for justice shall never wholly end,
Nowhere else but here good must rise upon evil bent!
