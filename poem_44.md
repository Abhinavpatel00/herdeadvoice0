# Battling the Tide of Fear

## Abhinav Patel

With the weight of worries, anxiety grips her tight,
Her heart aches and suffocates with fear, each night.
Self-blame and shame flow through her veins in a flurry,
And she struggles to keep her composure, in such a hurry.

It's hard for her to even breathe, to find some peace,
But still she fights, her strength refusing to decrease.
In the darkness of the night, she finds a calming pace,
And the silence brings her comfort, in this lonely space.

She knows the journey ahead won't be an easy climb,
But she refuses to give up, to let fear rule her time.
She's a warrior, fighting to conquer her doubts,
And with each step forward, she silences the shouts.

It's uneasy for her to put her undeserved pain in words,
The hurt she feels is so obscure, like a flock of birds.
Her soul cries out with deep and loud screams,
As heart-wrenching memories haunt her in her dreams.

And so she holds it in, letting it simmer and stew,
Until it spills over, leaving her feeling so blue.
The tears of her started drying in her eyes,
Leaving behind a heart with shallow beats and sighs.

The grey skies without rain symbolize her fear,
So intense and limitless, it's hard to bear.
Her soul can't seem to find faith and trust,
And she wonders why she was left in this unjust.

They need to change and admit their mistakes,
For her sake, for her heart's sake.
In a sea of haunted thoughts and unbearable pain,
Her childhood dreams and wishes all gone in vain.

The unavoidable self-blame and soul injury,
Crushes her with each moment, suffocating her identity.
She's in a heartbreaking state of mind,
Where hope seems so hard to find.

Lost in the chaos and deep despair,
She searches for a spark of strength to repair.
Her heart beats with a heavy weight,
As she struggles to keep her head up and fate.

She fights so hard against the tide of fear,
To find a way out and persevere.
To heal the wounds that run so deep,
And awaken from each pain-induced sleep.

She knows it won't be easy to face her fears,
But with each small step, she'll overcome the tears.
She'll let go of the hurt and the past,
And hold on to the love and light that will last.

In the depths of her soul, she fights the tide
Of fear and pain that threaten to divide
Her from the light that shines within her heart
A flame that burns, steadfast and bright, impart

The strength and courage she needs to face
The wounds that haunt her and leave no trace
Of hope or joy, but still she rises
Above the darkness, she perseveres and surprises

With each sleepless night, she faces her fears,
And awakens to a world that's often unclear.
