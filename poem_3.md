# Unforgotten Whirlwinds of Heart

## Abhinav Patel

Our society accused her of bringing shame
By snatching away her hopes and even name
They treated her like an animal, not a girl
Just to satisfy their barbaric thirst, biassed thinking which unfurls

The stigma surrounding sexual violence, won't let our heroine wear her
crown
She's not alone in this battle, many are enduring the same frown

It demands a change from us all to stand and put a shield against such
crime
And listen to stories of those who were affected with time
It's time for no more oppression worn as a crown
Time to lay down arm to prevent future destruction around
