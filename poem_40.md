# A Tale of Hypocrisy and Redemption

## Abhinav Patel

In this world of hypocrisy and shame,
She seeks boys who bring her fame,
But what of those who raise their voice,
Against injustice and make a choice?

He who truly care and show,
Sympathy and kindness that we know,
Are often left to fade away,
As she chases the ones who play.

This wrong thinking, it must be said,
Is what makes him feel misled,
Fame and wealth are all she see,
Not the heart that beats within thee.

He who saves girls from trafficking,
Gets no love or attention for his deserving,
While those who entertains on screen with fake action ,
Often become the object of her affection.

The sad truth is that she turned her eye blind;
To him who have a heart so kind,
And the ones she see, will continue to contribute,
To the exploitation of girls who are destitute.

But if we stop chasing wealth and fame,
And start valuing a his true aim,
Then maybe we can put an end;
To the abuse and the pain that we intend.

So let us learn to look soul inside,
And see the person, not just the pride,
For it is only then we'll find;
A love that's pure and truly kind.

And if she refuses to marry a boy;
Who demands dowry as their ploys.
And values him who's bright , do social work,
Then maybe the abuse will stop and not lurk.

In the search for love, which boy will she choose?
The one who raises his voice or shows sympathy too?
But why does her nature show such hypocrisy?
Expecting goodness, yet always falling for those with fame and money.

Skewed perspective of her mislead him, causing wrong choices and
much noise
Where they believe exploiting others can be overlooked with fame and
toys.
The world seems to value those who are rich and famous,
A truth that can't be denied, no matter how outrageous.

It's disheartening to see his work towards the better world;
gets short area , short term love and affection
And the ones who just show offs with money, gold
Are well known to the world for their fake action

When he hears her crave for fame and wealth,
He feels like an outsider, true to himself.
Her desires seem foreign, to him unknown,
He works to change the world, to be better known

A world where everyone is valued for their true worth,
And girls are seen beyond their physical features from birth.
A world where love is not based on wealth and fame,
But on compassion, sincerity, and a deeper flame.

Let's create a society where true heroes are celebrated,
And their good deeds are never understated.
Where love is not based on superficial things,
But on what truly makes our hearts sing.

She chased money, fame, and charm,
But neglect him whose heart so warm.
She want someone who can treat her right,
But failed to see who stands up for her fight.

He tried to be good, to be kind,
But society values fame over a gentle mind.
The world is cruel, it's hard to survive,
So some versions of him turn wrong just to thrive.

Her dream of a prince, a perfect mate,
But only sees the surface and not the weight.
She judged them by the looks, by the cars,
And missed the one who would heal their scars.

He yearn for love, for connection,
But society values wealth over affection.
He worked hard, he sacrificed,
But in the end, he is left with hollow eyes.

She crave attention, validation,
But forget the true value of appreciation.
She fall for the player, the heartless one,
And miss the one who would never be gone.

He strive for respect, for honour,
But society values power over valour.
He fought for justice, for the greater good,
But in the end, he is misunderstood.

She want a hero, a saviour,
But only see the fame and the flavor.
She ignored the one who's fighting the war,
And missed the one who would never ignore.

He hoped for understanding, for empathy;
But society values dominance over sympathy,
He tried to listen, to comfort, to care;
But in the end, he is left with despair.

She need to change, to open her eyes,
To see the good, to value the wise,
She must learn to judge by the heart,
And not by the money, fame, or art.

He need to change, to break the mold,
To see the value of love and hold.

He must learn to appreciate the soul,
And not just the power, money, or goal.
