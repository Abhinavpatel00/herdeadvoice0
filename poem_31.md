# Her concealed wounds

## Abhinav Patel

Her cries are still untold,
And her heart so cold,
She's breathing but not air,
Broken soul and anxiety, what a mispair!

Smile , laugh were already snatched,
Those monstrous acts and expressions she watched.
Emotionlessness grabbed her soul deep inside filled with dark;
But each pain , memory were sharp,

What she did to be in this state ?
As you all said no , she was never late.

Her voice full of deep sorrow and heart full of scars ,
She is also human,Why did she got those marks ?

Her injuries are now deadly rain ;
Which not visible dont even pain.

The shine of sun is the darkest night;
But she seems normal to eye sight.

The black of complete silence is still unseen,
Why don't you hear her carefully ? She isn't a machine !
