# Her Untold Silent Screams

## Abhinav Patel

Butterflies in her dreams were replaced by fear  
Life looks like a dark, miserable road without cheer  
She holds this emptiness that can't be filled  
And there is desolation that veils the glinted field

As she stands paralyzed and strengthless  
Victim of sexual violence makes senseless  
Still, she gathers all her courage and says a prayer  
That justice will cure her inner dullness, despair

But she knows deep down that she's not to blame  
For the heinous acts inflicted on her frame  
It's not her fault that someone chose to harm  
And leave her with these scars so deep and stark

She deserves to be heard, to be believed  
And for the perpetrator to be rightly grieved  
For the justice to be served and seen  
And for her shattered soul to finally glean

The hope and light that once shone so bright  
Before the darkness took over her life  
She can reclaim her power and voice  
And take control of her own path and choice  

It won't be easy, the road ahead is tough  
But with love, support, and courage enough  
She can heal, grow, and thrive  
And create a life that feels truly alive  

She can find her faith again in the midst of the pain  
And rise above the trauma that once did reign  
She can reclaim her joy, her dreams, her hope  
And never again feel like she can't cope.  
The marks she got never gonna disappear  
Her heart trembled with fear  

No one should be reduced to this painful state  
Everyone deserves their basic human right to be safe  
That can't be bought or sold and certainly not with pain  
But strengthened within all hearts that come together and gain  
This is a fight against injustice, abuse, and crime  
Let's work towards a world where every being feels sublime
