# He Needs To Unlearn the Toxic Learnings

## Abhinav Patel

The pain that we feel, the anguish that we bear
When our sisters and daughters are treated so unfair
Every moment, every day, they fear for their lives
In a world that's filled with darkness, where no light thrives

I'll write, I'll give efforts, I'll work for justice until I die
I know I can't stop everyone, but I'll still try
If someone can stop someone, and that someone stops another
It will become everyone, and we'll see the world together

If boys from childhood are taught to respect, to love and to care
To understand the real meaning of consent and not just to dare
Then one day, it will end, the world will change
And girls will be free, no longer be afraid

It's not enough to just say "boys will be boys";
And accept that girls are just toys for their joys
We must challenge toxic masculinity every day
And show that real strength comes in a different way

Girls should be able to walk without fear
Without the constant threat of someone coming near
To take what is not theirs, to violate their rights
To leave them scarred, traumatized, with sleepless nights
