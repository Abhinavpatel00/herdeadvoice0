# Healing : Strength To be stronger

## Abhinav Patel

We stand with her, a survivor brave,

Whose strength and courage did not cave,

In the face of darkness and despair,

her will to live did not impair.

May she find peace and healing now,

May justice come with furrowed brows,

And may the scars that do remain,

Be a testament to her strength regained.
