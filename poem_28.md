# Kindness The Ray Within

## Abhinav Patel

Kindness is a virtue that can heal,
A touch of compassion that we can feel,
It’s the balm that soothes our pain,
The ray of hope amidst the rain.

A kind word or gesture goes a long way,
It can brighten up someone's day,
It costs nothing to be kind,
But the impact it has is one of a kind.

In a world full of chaos and strife,
Kindness is the thread that binds us to life,
It’s the beacon of light that shows us the way,
The guiding force that leads us astray.

It’s easy to be caught up in our own needs,
But kindness is about fulfilling others' deeds,
It’s about lending a hand to those in need,
To help them overcome the impossible deed.

It’s the act of giving without any expectation;
Of spreading joy and love in every nation,
It’s the language that all can understand,
The thread that unites every land.

Kindness is the antidote to hate,
The medicine that cures all our fate,
It’s the force that can conquer all,
The power that can make us stand tall.

So let’s be kind in all that we do,
And spread this message to others too,
For a little kindness can go a long way,
And brighten up someone's darkest day.

The world is vast and full of wonder,
But sometimes, we're left to ponder,
What is our place in this great expanse?
What is the meaning of our life's dance?

We search for answers, high and low,
In books, in people, in places we go,
We seek the wisdom of the sages,
And look for clues in ancient pages.

But what if the answers we seek,
Are not found in words we speak?
What if the truth lies in our hearts,
In the compassion that each of us imparts?

Kindness is the key, this we know,
It's what makes our world a better show,
It's what binds us, heart to heart,
And makes us stronger, right from the start.

Kindness is not a simple act,
It's a way of life, that we must enact,
It's not just about being nice,
It's about being good, being wise.

We must be kind to ourselves first,
For it's from within that kindness bursts,
We must nurture our own self care,
And show ourselves the love we all deserve to bear.

But kindness must not stop with us,
We must spread it far and wide, without fuss,
We must be kind to those we meet,
To strangers on the street, and even those we greet.

Kindness is a powerful force,
It can change the world, without remorse,
It can heal the hurt, and soothe the pain,
And bring sunshine, after the rain.
