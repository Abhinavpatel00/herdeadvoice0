# Search of Light in Dark

## Aditi Jogdand

Her dreams of angel's stories
Every moment surrounded with unseen worries

She tried so hard to fight
But didn't found that light

Her soul tired by the pain of not painting wounds
Her breaths near to death, even when oxygen around

The delightfulness of her heart so bright
Her soul soul says now only death was right

Wetness of her eyes and trembling lips
And a slow and continuous river over her cheeks

one who never scared of darkness nor even depth
But lost something called faith

She don't have will to bring a desire of a sea
but there's something more that she can see

Little little moments started bringing peace and calm
Along with the shadow and warmth

Her wounds of inhumanity still cracks her heart
But now she learning slow what's her worth
