# The Unshaded Darkness

## Aditi Jogdand

It is terrible to even get heard right now
Feel she feels don't deserve to even breathe somehow
She isn't sure whether she is alive or dead
The marks and memories brings her in the feeling of lying on deathbed

Each thing wasn't this way before ,
Now just darkness and self blame breaths as her soul's core

Why don't we hear and accept which is true?
Why do we need to keep her voice suppressed with fear, emotional
blackmailing's glue?
The darkness of her heart will still be the same
Or at least now, just stop this cheap game !
