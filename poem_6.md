# Her Smothered Breaths

## Abhinav Patel

When she wants to speak up for her rights
She is told to silence, put out of sight
For looking outwards, fighting in vain
They're seen as monsters and scorned again.

A lifetime of violence year after year
All the while almost no one hears
The cries and voices that plead for justice
It's silenced instead with centuries of dust.

It's sad when victim is seen with shame,
As if the guilt lies in her name.

To be devastated and violated this way,
So much to bear no words can say.

So, many of us must rise to defend her right
To join forces as a mass uprising with might.
We have a moral obligation to stand strong,
And protect the victims of this horrible wrong.
