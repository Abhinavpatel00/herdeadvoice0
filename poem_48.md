# The Nameless Truth

## Abhinav Patel

In the depths of pain, we find the truth
The darkness reveals what we thought was smooth
The struggles of the soul, the battles we fight
In the midst of chaos, we find the light

I see her, quiet and alone
In a world she can’t call home
Trembling from what came before
This pain she can’t ignore.

She hides behind a mask of shame
Forced to play a cruel game
Her body, no longer her own
Leaves her feeling torn and alone.
It was in the place she should feel safe
But instead, it became a dark loathsome space
A trap she could never escape
A nightmare that continued to take shape.

She longs to scream and be set free
But fear holds her hostage for all to see
Her pleas for help echo unheard
As the world moves on without a word.

But she’s not alone, there are so many more
Whose harrowing tales go untold
We need to hear them, behind each scar is a story
To let them know their stories we’ll hold.

It happens in our very homes
Where supposed love rots to the bones
Hands that should hold us with tender care
Now become tools that cause despair

The workplace too can breed danger
Where promotions hinge on a sexual stranger
their bodies used as currency
Do they work for them or for their dignity?

And in public spaces, they are never free
their bodies subject to scrutiny
Catcalls and stares, unwelcome touches
A constant battle for our own clutches

The eyes closed or open just a dilemma
It's life , not a scene of cinema
To establish or create sense of fear in minds
He used to hurt her in each possible way he finds
